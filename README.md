### Current Courses at the University of Chicago

- **CMSC 22240: Computer Architecture for Scientists**
  - Designed to provide an understanding of the key scientific ideas that underpin the extraordinary capabilities of today's computers, including speed (gigahertz), illusion of sequential order (relativity), dynamic locality (warping space), parallelism, keeping it cheap - and low-energy (e-field scaling), and of course their ability as universal information processing engines. These scientific "miracles" are robust, and provide a valuable longer-term understanding of computer capabilities, performance, and limits to the wealth of computer scientists practicing data science, software development, or machine learning.

- **CMSC 22880: Introduction to Quantum Computing**
  - This introduction to quantum computing will cover the key principles of quantum information science and how they relate to quantum computing as well as the notation and operations used in QIS. We will then take these building blocks and linear algebra principles to build up to several quantum algorithms and complete several quantum programs using a mainstream quantum programming language.

- **CMSC 15100: Introduction to Computer Science I**
  - This sequence, which is recommended for all students planning to take more advanced courses in computer science, introduces computer science mostly through the study of programming in functional (Scheme) and imperative (C) programming languages. Topics include program design, control and data abstraction, recursion and induction, higher-order programming, types and polymorphism, time and space analysis, memory management, and data structures including lists, trees, and graphs.

- **CMSC 15200: Introduction to Computer Science II**
  - This sequence, which is recommended for all students planning to take more advanced courses in computer science, introduces computer science mostly through the study of programming in functional (Scheme) and imperative (C) programming languages. Topics include program design, control and data abstraction, recursion and induction, higher-order programming, types and polymorphism, time and space analysis, memory management, and data structures including lists, trees, and graphs. 
  - [Repository](https://github.com/gypark23/CS152)
- **[CMSC 15400: Introduction to Computer Systems](https://sites.google.com/site/cs154uchicago)**
  - This course covers the basics of computer systems from a programmer's perspective. Topics include data representation, machine language programming, exceptions, memory systems, and being the client of an operating system. Our goal is to help students be more effective programmers and to prepare students for advanced systems courses, such as architecture, compilers, operating systems, and networks. The course involves homeworks, exams, labs, and programming projects. Proficiency in C programming is assumed, as per the course pre-requisites.

- **[CMSC 22000: Introduction to Software Development](https://uchicago-cs.github.io/cmsc22000/)**
  - Developing a software system (e.g., an application, a web server, an operating system, etc.) requires much more than just knowing how to program. Software development encompasses multiple activities, such as systems design, implementation, testing, debugging, deployment, documentation, and maintenance, all weaved together by following a specific methodology. Not just that, software development is a highly collaborative activity, where certain skills, like effective communication and the ability to give/receive feedback, can be key to the success of a software project. This class bridges the gap between knowing how to program and knowing how to develop software: it is intended for students who have recently completed CMSC 15200 Introduction to Computer Science 2 or CMSC 16200 Honors Introduction to Computer Science 2, and will cover fundamental concepts and skills in software development, providing a solid foundation before students move on to majors-level classes that require developing complex software systems. The class will cover foundational topics in software development in lectures, but will also include hands-on homeworks, guest lectures from industry speakers, and a collaborative quarter-long project, where the entire class, divided into teams with specific responsibilities, will work on developing new features for an existing software system.

- **STAT 23400: Statistical Models and Method 1**
  - This course is recommended for students throughout the natural and social sciences who want a broad background in statistical methodology and exposure to probability models and the statistical concepts underlying the methodology. Probability is developed for the purpose of modeling outcomes of random phenomena. Random variables and their expectations are studied; including means and variances of linear combinations and an introduction to conditional expectation. Binomial, Poisson, normal and other standard probability distributions are considered. Some probability models are studied mathematically, and others are studied via computer simulation. Sampling distributions and related statistical methods are explored mathematically, studied via simulation, and illustrated on data. Methods include, but are not limited to, inference for means and proportions for one- and two-sample problems, two-way tables, correlation, and simple linear regression. Graphical and numerical data description are used for exploration, communication of results, and comparing mathematical consequences of probability models and data. Mathematics employed is to the level of single-variable differential and integral calculus and sequences and series.
